# Minimal_E-Bike_Torquesensor_Precontroller
based on a digispark

Reads in the analog torque signal and the digital PAS signal and calculates the output to the throttle connector of a commercial E-bike BLDC-Controller. The assistfactor can be adjusteb by the potentiometer. Caution, the digispark has a build in 1k Pullup resistor! So use a linear Poti with appox 1k resistance
